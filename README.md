Learn about the gravity of the Solar System's planets

## Overview

Welcome to the Joxy app. Use this app to test the gravity on each planet of the Solar System through AR.

This app makes a better experience if in landscape orientation. Of course if you like the portrait orientation it will still work.

## Running the Project

The project can be run on Swift Playgrounds 4.0.2 on iPadOS 15.4.
